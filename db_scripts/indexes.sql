  ON Booking (room_id, start_date, end_date);

/*
  Justification:
    idx_booking_room_dates -> improves queries filtering by room_id & date range.
    idx_employee_hotel     -> speeds up lookups/joins by employeeâ€™s hotel_id.
    idx_customer_email     -> quickly finds a customer by email (common in user logins).
    idx_room_price         -> accelerates queries or range searches on room price.
